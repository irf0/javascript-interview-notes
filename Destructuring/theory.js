// Cheat-Sheet (Note This Down)

// Destructuring = unpacking values from arrays or objects into variables in one line.
// Arrays → position based
// Objects → key based
// Defaults work only when value is undefined
// Rename using key: newName
// Nested destructuring is common in real apps
// Very common in React & APIs

//Spread = expanding / copying elements of an iterable (array, object, string).
