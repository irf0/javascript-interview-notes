🚀 JavaScript & React Interview Prep
Welcome to my personal knowledge base for frontend interview preparation. 
This repository is a curated collection of notes, code snippets, and conceptual deep-dives into the JavaScript ecosystem.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this repo is to provide a structured roadmap for mastering the technical nuances of modern web development. 
Whether it’s understanding the Event Loop or mastering React's reconciliation process, these notes focus on the "What", "Why" and "How." of topics.
